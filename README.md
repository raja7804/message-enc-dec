Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool 🔐

A simple Python program that performs text encryption and decryption using the classical Caesar Cipher algorithm. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of cryptography, string manipulation, and modular arithmetic in Python.


🧩 Features

Encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom shift value
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
Keeps numbers, spaces, and special characters unchanged
Interactive menu-driven interface for easy use
Simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly

⚙ How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.
Each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example:

Message: HELLO
Shift: 3
Encrypted: KHOOR

Decryption works by shifting the letters back by the same value.

🚀 Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment or terminal.
2. Choose:

     → Encrypt a message

     → Decrypt a message

     → Exit

3. Enter the text and shift value when prompted.
4. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.
